# Webpack, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, React, Jest

A starter project which is aimed to showcase how can we set up:
- Webpack (with environment specific configurations)
- TypeScript
- ESLInt: with TypeScript and React support
- Prettier: to ensure code-style is consistent in the project
- React
- Jest: for testing
- git configuration + .editorconfig: to ensure proper line endings, file encodings

Added benefit is that test assertions can be ran independently inside any IDE, e.g.: Webstorm.
