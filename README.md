# Webpack, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, React, Jest

![CI-Badge](https://github.com/noherczeg/webpack-ts-eslint-prettier-react-jest/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)

A starter project which is aimed to showcase how can we set up:
- Webpack (with environment specific configurations)
- TypeScript
- ESLint: with TypeScript and React support
- Prettier: to ensure code-style is consistent in the project
- React
- Jest: for testing
- git configuration + .editorconfig: to ensure proper line endings, file encodings

Added benefit is that test assertions can be ran independently inside any IDE, e.g.: WebStorm.
